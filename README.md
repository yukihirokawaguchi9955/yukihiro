ðŸš€ Ready to Build Your Next Big Project â€“ Letâ€™s Create Something Amazing Together!


Hi! Iâ€™m Yukihiro, a senior full-stack developer with over 8 years of experience, and Iâ€™m looking for my next exciting opportunity. Whether youâ€™re a startup needing a custom web app, blockchain business, an e-commerce business wanting a high-converting store, or a company looking to streamline operations with a seamless database integration, Iâ€™m here to help bring your vision to life. Letâ€™s build something that drives results and delights your users!

 I bring a versatile skill set to the table, covering both front-end and back-end development:

E-commerce Solutions: Iâ€™ve built and optimized online stores using Shopify and Magento, helping businesses increase conversions by up to 30%.

Dynamic Web Apps: With React, Next.js, and Nuxt.js, I create fast, interactive, and responsive applications that keep users engaged.

CMS Platforms: Iâ€™m an expert in WordPress and Drupal, delivering flexible, user-friendly websites tailored to your brand.

Backend Development: Using Python, I ensure your systems are secure, scalable, and efficient.

One of my favorite projects was for a small e-commerce client who needed a Shopify store with advanced search functionality. I integrated their product database, built a custom search interface with filters, and optimized the site to load in under 2 secondsâ€”resulting in a 25% boost in sales within the first month. Iâ€™d love to bring that same impact to your project!

What Sets Me Apart What makes me unique is my ability to handle the full development lifecycleâ€”from designing a stunning front-end to building a robust back-end. Iâ€™m not just a coder; Iâ€™m a problem-solver who focuses on delivering solutions that are user-friendly, fast, and aligned with your business goals. Plus, Iâ€™m a strong communicator who values collaboration, ensuring weâ€™re always on the same page.

What Iâ€™m Looking For Iâ€™m eager to work with companies that value innovation, collaboration, and quality. Whether youâ€™re a startup, a growing business, or an established brand, Iâ€™d love to help with:

Building or revamping e-commerce stores.

Creating dynamic web applications.

Developing custom CMS solutions.

Integrating databases for seamless functionality.
